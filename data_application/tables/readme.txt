The enumeration in the files corresponds to the table enumeration in the paper.

Each file can be run on its own, after data_preparation.R in "./data_application/" is performed once.

Regression results are produced in two seperate files. One computes regression coefficients, while a corresponding file computes bootstrapped standard errors. The number of replication used in the paper is 1,000.
